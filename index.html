         <h2><a href="https://favrestaurants.netlify.com/">Favorite Restaurants Project</a></h2>
         <p>My Coding Bootcamp class built this together. We each focused on a type of restaurant and the 
           CSS that went along with it as well at the home page and the CSS for the home page and then making all of
           our files flow together as one webpage. We also practiced building a Hamburger Menu with this 
           project and making sure it worked after combining our individual files. We used HTML and CS to build this project along with
           online learning and research mostly using Bootstrap, W3Schools and MDN Web Docs.

         <p>In this project I practiced building a basic contact form using Firebase to collect the data 
           that was entered. We used Javascript, CSS and HTML to build this as well as learning from online resources such as Bootstrap.</p>

<div class= "aboutContent" id="aboutPage">
  <h3 id="greeting">Hi Y'all!</h3> 
  My name is Kristi Chenault Herin and I live in Tennessee (outside of Chattanooga). 
  I started coding in November of 2019 when I took a Coding Bootcamp course and I dove head first into the world of
  JavaScript, HTML and CSS. I am also interested in Data Analytics and in my spare time I enjoy taking online courses
  to further my knowledge of all things coding. 
  <br>I got married to my husband, Paul, in 2015 and we have 2 cats at home (Artemis and Louis). I love to run and I can be found entering
  local races on the weekends. I also enjoy Crossfit, Ashtanga Yoga and (when my body needs a rest day) reading and some 
  good old fashioned Netflix! I'm also a Disney-loving adult and I try to go to Disney World at least once a year 
  (usually for a runDisney Race Weekend).
  <br>
  Please have a look around my webpage and feel free to contact me using any of the methods listed in the
